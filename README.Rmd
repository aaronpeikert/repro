The goal of `repro` is to make the setup of reproducible workflows as easy as possible. To that end it builds upon the great [`usethis`-package](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis). `repro` currently undergoes significant changes to support more workflows than just the one proposed by [Peikert & Brandmaier (2019)](https://psyarxiv.com/8xzqy/). You may want to install the [`worcs`](https://github.com/cjvanlissa/worcs) package from CRAN for a user-friendly workflow that meets most requirements of reproducibility and open science.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of repro from [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro) with:

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("remotes"))install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("aaronpeikert/repro")
```

## Contribution

I am more then happy if you want to contribute, but I ask you kindly to note that the 'repro' project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

A contribution is especially welcome if it follows these principles:

1. The `repro` package aids the user setup reproducibility tools.
2. The reproduction itself must not require the `repro` package.
3. Do not suprisingly rely on the system or project state or change them.
