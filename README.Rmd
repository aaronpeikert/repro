The goal of repro is to make the setup of a reproducible workflow with RMarkdown, Git, Make & Docker as easy as possible. To that end it builds upon the great [`usethis`-package](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis). The reproducible workflow mirrors the one proposed by [Peikert & Brandmaier (2019)](https://psyarxiv.com/8xzqy/).

## Installation

You can install the latest version of repro from [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro) with:

``` r
if(!require("remotes"))install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("aaronpeikert/repro")
```
