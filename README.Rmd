The goal of `repro` is to make the setup of reproducible workflows as easy as possible. To that end it builds upon the great [`usethis`-package](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis). As `repro` curently undergoes major changes to support more workflows then just the one proposed by [Peikert & Brandmaier (2019)](https://psyarxiv.com/8xzqy/), you may want to take a look at [`worcs`](https://github.com/cjvanlissa/worcs).
